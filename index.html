    The intended purpose of this repo is to place a lot of my learning on various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3,
    JavaScript and Swift in a single resource. Its not really intended for anyone in particular but me.
</p>
<p>
    The goal would be to start small and build upon concepts, ideas and technical implementations and put them right
    here.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see there is not much styling going on and that's because I don't want to just add a Bootstrap and
    pretend like I know something.
