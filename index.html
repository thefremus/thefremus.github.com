    The intended purpose of this repo is to place a lot of my learning on various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3,
    JavaScript and Swift in a single resource. Its not really intended for anyone in particular but me.
</p>
<p>
    The goal would be to start small and build upon concepts, ideas and technical implementations and put them right
    here.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see there is not much styling going on and that's because I don't want to just add a Bootstrap and
    pretend like I know something.

<h1>Elements with different contextual meaning in HTML5</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>&lt;b&gt;</strong> - no longer represents boldface but is now used to indicate "stylistically offset"
        text
        without conveying importance. Use <strong>&lt;b&gt;</strong> for keywords, product names and actionable items.
    </li>
</ul>
