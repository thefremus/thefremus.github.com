    The intended purpose of this repo is to place a lot of my learning on various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3,
    JavaScript, C#, SQL and Swift in a single resource. Its not really intended for anyone in particular but me.
</p>
<p>
    The goal would be to start small and build upon concepts, ideas and technical implementations and put them right
    here.

    As you can see there is not much styling going on and that's because I don't want to just add a Bootstrap and
    pretend like I know something.
